  normative_reference_origin: ATAG 2.0 text references WCAG 2.0 directly in some criteria.
  interpretation_for_this_project: Resolve WCAG-linked checks against WCAG 2.2 first,
    with explicit handling for SC 4.1.1 removal.
  exception_notes:
  - WCAG 2.2 subsumes WCAG 2.0 and 2.1 except SC 4.1.1 (Parsing).
  - Keep ATAG normative wording unchanged; apply cross-version linkage metadata for
    ingestion.
