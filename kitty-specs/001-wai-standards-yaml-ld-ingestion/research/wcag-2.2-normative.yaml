  code: 1.1.1
  title: Non-text Content
  level: A
  normative_text: All non-text content that is presented to the user has a text alternative
    that serves the equivalent purpose, except for the situations listed below. If
    non-text content is a control or accepts user input, then it has a name that describes
    its purpose. (Refer to Success Criterion 4.1.2 for additional requirements for
    controls and content that accepts user input.) If non-text content is time-based
    media, then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the
    non-text content. (Refer to Guideline 1.2 for additional requirements for media.)
    If non-text content is a test or exercise that would be invalid if presented in
    text , then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification of the
    non-text content. If non-text content is primarily intended to create a specific
    sensory experience , then text alternatives at least provide descriptive identification
    of the non-text content. If the purpose of non-text content is to confirm that
    content is being accessed by a person rather than a computer, then text alternatives
    that identify and describe the purpose of the non-text content are provided, and
    alternative forms of CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory
    perception are provided to accommodate different disabilities. If non-text content
    is pure decoration , is used only for visual formatting, or is not presented to
    users, then it is implemented in a way that it can be ignored by assistive technology
    .

    not justified (aligned to both the left and the right margins). Line spacing (leading)
    is at least space-and-a-half within paragraphs, and paragraph spacing is at least
    1.5 times larger than the line spacing. Text can be resized without assistive
    technology up to 200 percent in a way that does not require the user to scroll
    horizontally to read a line of text on a full-screen window . Content is not required
    to use these values. The requirement is that a mechanism is available for users
    to change these presentation aspects. The mechanism can be provided by the browser
    or other user agent. Content is not required to provide the mechanism. Writing
    systems for some languages use different presentation aspects to improve readability
    and legibility. If a presentation aspect in this success criterion is not used
    in a writing system, content in that writing system does not need to use that
    presentation setting and can conform without it. Authors are encouraged to follow

    layout for usage or meaning. 320 CSS pixels is equivalent to a starting viewport
    width of 1280 CSS pixels wide at 400% zoom. For web content which is designed
    to scroll horizontally (e.g., with vertical text), 256 CSS pixels is equivalent
    to a starting viewport height of 1024 CSS pixels at 400% zoom. Examples of content
    which requires two-dimensional layout are images required for understanding (such
    as maps and diagrams), video, games, presentations, data tables (not individual
    cells), and interfaces where it is necessary to keep toolbars in view while manipulating

    popups that display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered
    by this criterion. This criterion applies to content that appears in addition
    to the triggering component itself. Since hidden components that are made visible
    on keyboard focus (such as links used to skip to another part of a page) do not
    present additional content they are not covered by this criterion.'

  normative_text: All functionality of the content is operable through a keyboard
    interface without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except
    where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's
    movement and not just the endpoints. This exception relates to the underlying
    function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter
    text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the
    underlying function (text input) does not. This does not forbid and should not
    discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard
    operation.

    keys or other standard exit methods, the user is advised of the method for moving
    focus away. Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere

    the following is true: The user is allowed to turn off the time limit before encountering
    it; or The user is allowed to adjust the time limit before encountering it over
    a wide range that is at least ten times the length of the default setting; or
    The user is warned before time expires and given at least 20 seconds to extend
    the time limit with a simple action (for example, "press the space bar"), and
    the user is allowed to extend the time limit at least ten times; or The time limit
    is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative
    to the time limit is possible; or The time limit is essential and extending it
    would invalidate the activity; or The time limit is longer than 20 hours. This
    success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected
    changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success
    criterion should be considered in conjunction with Success Criterion 3.2.1 , which
    puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.'

    all of the following are true: For any moving, blinking or scrolling information
    that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented
    in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause , stop,
    or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity
    where it is essential ; and For any auto-updating information that (1) starts
    automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a
    mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency
    of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.
    For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to Guideline
    2.3 . Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere
    with a user''s ability to use the whole page, all content on the web page (whether
    it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion.
    See Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference . Content that is updated periodically
    by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve
    or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of
    the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible,
    and in many situations could be misleading to do so. An animation that occurs
    as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if
    interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating

    consent before user identification has been authenticated and before user data
    is preserved. In cases where the user is a minor, explicit consent may not be
    solicited in most jurisdictions, countries or regions. Consultation with privacy
    professionals and legal counsel is advised when considering data preservation

    focus. If the user can reveal the focused component without advancing the keyboard
    focus, the component with focus is not considered visually hidden due to author-created

    color are not modified by the author. What is perceived as the user interface
    component or sub-component (to determine the perimeter) depends on its visual
    presentation . The visual presentation includes the component''s visible content
    , border, and component-specific background. It does not include shadow and glow
    effects outside the component''s content, background, or border. Examples of sub-components
    that may receive a focus indicator are menu items in an opened drop-down menu,
    or focusable cells in a grid. Contrast calculations can be based on colors defined
    within the technology (such as HTML , CSS, and SVG). Pixels modified by user agent
